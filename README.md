This plugin allows players to create and manage their own holograms through a GUI. As a server owner, you can sell this perk to players or just allow everyone to manage their own holograms in a simple and easy GUI.

The plugin supports blocking hologram creation in specified WorldGuard regions, configurable in config.

Requires DecentHolograms plugin to be installed.
WorldGuard should be installed if you require hologram region blocking
